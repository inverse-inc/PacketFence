	#	syslog - to syslog (see also the "syslog_facility", below.
	#	stdout - standard output
	#	stderr - standard error.

	#  The logging messages for the server are appended to the

	#  If this configuration parameter is set, then log messages for
	#  a *request* go to this file, rather than to radius.log.
	#
	#  i.e. This is a log file per request, once the server has accepted
	#  the request as being from a valid client.  Messages that are
	#  not associated with a request still go to radius.log.
	#
	#  Not all log messages in the server core have been updated to use
	#  this new internal API.  As a result, some messages will still
	#  go to radius.log.  Please submit patches to fix this behavior.
	#
	#  The file name is expanded dynamically.  You should ONLY user
	#  server-side attributes for the filename (e.g. things you control).
	#  Using this feature MAY also slow down the server substantially,
	#  especially if you do thinks like SQL calls as part of the
	#  expansion of the filename.
	#
	#  The name of the log file should use attributes that don't change
	#  over the lifetime of a request, such as User-Name,
	#  Virtual-Server or Packet-Src-IP-Address.  Otherwise, the log
	#  messages will be distributed over multiple files.
	#
	#  Logging can be enabled for an individual request by a special
	#  dynamic expansion macro:  %{debug: 1}, where the debug level
	#  for this request is set to '1' (or 2, 3, etc.).  e.g.
	#
	#	...
	#	update control {
	#	       Tmp-String-0 = "%{debug:1}"
	#	}
	#	...
	#
	#  The attribute that the value is assigned to is unimportant,
	#  and should be a "throw-away" attribute with no side effects.
	#

	#
	#  Which syslog facility to use, if ${destination} == "syslog"

	#  The exact values permitted here are OS-dependent.  You probably
	#  don't want to change this.
