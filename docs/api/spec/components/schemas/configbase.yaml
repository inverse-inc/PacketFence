          at Layer 7 (HTTP level) effectively doing reverse proxying then the captive
          portal no longer sees the IP of the node trying to access the portal. In
          that case, the load-balancers must do SSL offloading and add a X-Forwarded-By
          header in the HTTP traffic they forward to PacketFence. Most do by default.
          Then in this parameter you must specify the IP of the various load balancers.
          This will instruct the captive portal to look for client IPs in the X-Forwarded-For
          instead of the actual TCP session when it matches an IP in the list. Format
          is a comma separated list of IPs. Note: Apache access log format is not
          changed to automatically log the X-Forwarded-By header. Modify conf/httpd.conf.d/captive-portal-common.conf
          to use load balanced combined instead of combined in CustomLog statement.'
