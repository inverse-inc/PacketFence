    autoregister:
      description: This activates automatic registation of devices for the profile.
        Devices will not be shown a captive portal and RADIUS authentication credentials
        will be used to register the device. This option only makes sense in the context
        of an 802.1x authentication.

        a local account that is created while registering. Note that activating this
        disables the on-site registration on this connection profile. Also, make sure
        the sources on the connection profile have "Create local account" enabled.

    reuse_dot1x_credentials:
      description: This option emulates SSO when someone needs to face the captive
        portal after a successful 802.1x connection. 802.1x credentials are reused
        on the portal to match an authentication and get the appropriate actions.
        As a security precaution, this option will only reuse 802.1x credentials if
        there is an authentication source matching the provided realm. This means,
        if users use 802.1x credentials with a domain part (username@domain, domain\username),
        the domain part needs to be configured as a realm under the RADIUS section
        and an authentication source needs to be configured for that realm. If users
        do not use 802.1x credentials with a domain part, only the NULL realm will
        be match IF an authentication source is configured for it.
