About this Guide
----------------

This guide has been created to give a quick start to configure the Cisco MSE with PacketFence 6.3+.
In the first section we will explain how to use the Cisco MSE in order to present a captive
portal based on the localization.
Then in the second section we will integrate the device localization in the node view.

Assumptions
-----------

* You have at least one server with PacketFence 6.3 or later.
* The PacketFence management IP will be 192.168.1.5.
* An account has been created on the MSE in order to use RESTful API of the MSE. (Read only for localization , write to create notifications)
* The Cisco MSE IP will be 192.168.1.6.

Portal based on localization
----------------------------

Step 1: Enable httpd.collector service on PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This service is mandatory and will receive the mse notifications in json format.
To enable this service go in `Configuration -> services` and tick services.httpd_collector and leave the default order.

Step 2: Create a notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This part can be done directly on the MSE web admin GUI but we include a Perl script in addons/mse-subscribe.pl that will help you to create one using the RESTful API of the MSE.

So let say that you have a username with write permissions on the MSE (mswrite/password) now go in /usr/local/pf/addons then run:

 ./mse-subscribe.pl --username=msewrite --password=password --url=http://192.168.1.6:8083 --target-ip=192.168.1.5 --target-port=9292 --url-path=/mse/ --zone=Campus>Building>Level>Zone --notification-name=Zone1

This will create the notification and print out the notifications configured on the MSE.
So now each time a device will enter or leave the specific zone PacketFence will be notified.

Step 3: Configure a portal filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In `Configuration Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles -> Add profile -> Advanced filter` specify an advanced filter like that:

 extended.mse_inout.locationMapHierarchy == "Campus>Building>Level>Zone"

And fill the other configuration needed to configure a connection profile then save it.

That's all, now when a device will hit the captive portal and will be in the specific zone then
it will hit this connection profile.

MSE Tab
-------

This configuration is really simple, you just have to enable and fill the URL, the username and password in `Configuration -> Integration -> Cisco Mobility Service Engine`.
So in our example:

 URL: http://192.168.1.6:8083
 Username: mseread
 Password: password

Now go in `Nodes` and click on a MAC address and you will see that a new tab appears, then if you click on it you will be able to retrieve the map and the localization of the device.
