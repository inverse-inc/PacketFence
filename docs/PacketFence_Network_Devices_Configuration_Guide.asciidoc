== About this Guide

This guide covers the configuration of network devices in order to integrate
them with PacketFence in VLAN enforcement. Switches, wireless controllers and
wireless access points are all considered network devices in PacketFence's
terms.

== Note on Inline enforcement support

There is no need to follow the instructions in this guide if you plan on deploying in inline enforcement, except RADIUS inline. In this case all you need to do is to have a flat layer 2 network up to PacketFence's inline interface with no other gateway available for devices to reach out to the Internet.

This technique is usually used when your network hardware does not support VLAN enforcement.

== Note on RADIUS accounting

Enabling RADIUS accounting on your network devices will significantly increase the database size and may cause performance issues. You should be aware of this and only use RADIUS accounting if it is really needed.
