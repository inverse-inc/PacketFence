//== Performance Optimizations

=== NT Key Caching ===

NOTE: This section assumes that you already have an Active Directory domain configuration both in _Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Domains -> Active Directory Domains_ and _Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Authentication Sources_. If you don't, you need to first configure those. Refer to the appropriate sections of this guide for details on how to configure those two components.

CAUTION: The cache requires minimally Windows Server 2008. Older versions will not work. To ensure a better performance and flexible NTLM authentication caching, Windows 2012 R2 or later version is recommended.

CAUTION: NT Key cache relies on timestamps such as "last password reset" of an account to determine the expiration time and cache dirty status, Timezone settings for PacketFence and Windows Domain Controller must be identical.

When using NTLM authentication against an Active Directory for 802.1X EAP-PEAP connections, this can become a bottleneck when handling dozens of authentications per seconds.

To overcome this limitation, it is possible to use a cache inside PacketFence to reduce the amount of authentications requiring an external NTLM authentication call.

If NT Key cache is enabled, PacketFence will try to find a valid NT key for the device being connected. If the device has passed the NTLM authentication recently, the corresponding NT Key will be returned immediately. No transitive login with domain controller will be performed. Otherwise, a transitive login will be performed and NT key will be cached if successfully pass the authentication.

NOTE: The NT Key cache doesn't cache any NT hashes or user passwords, it caches the NT session key for each connected device for a period of time.

NOTE: The NT Key cache also caches wrong password attempts to help block the devices that keep authenticating using wrong password (or old password) in order to protect the user account from being locked out in Domain Controller.


==== PacketFence Configuration

To Enable NT key caching, you need a valid domain config entry in _Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Domains -> Active Directory Domains_

At NT Key cache tab,

* Enable NT Key cache.
* Specify a cache expiration time. Ranges from 60 to 86400. Default is 12000 (in seconds).
* Fill in the Windows Group Policy Settings
 ** Account Lockout Threshold
 ** Reset Account Lockout Counter After
 ** Account Lockout Duration
 ** Old Password Allowed Period

image::domain-nt-key-cache.jpg[scaledwidth="100%",alt="NT Key cache settings"]

NOTE: Cache expiration time: a value longer than reauth period settings on the switch is recommended. E.g., If the reauth period on a Cisco switch is set to 10800s, a value less than 10800 may cause the cache entry to expire before reauth.

Those settings can be found on the Windows Domain Controller by the following steps:

Go to _Start menu -> Administrative Tools -> Group Policy Management_.

In the console tree, expand *Forest* -> *Domains* -> *Your Domain* -> *Group Policy Objects* -> *Default Domain Policy*

In the right panel, navigate to *Settings* page, You will have these parameters in *Policies* -> *Windows Settings* -> *Security Settings* -> *Account Policies, Account lockout policies*

For *Old Password Allowed Period*, There's no group policy settings. The default value is 60 (in minutes). It can be changed using the following guide:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/new-setting-modifies-ntlm-network-authentication

image::domain-windows-account-policy.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Windows Account Policies"]

NOTE: Steps may vary on different windows versions. The steps and screenshots above are from Windows Server 2022.

NOTE: In newer version of Windows Server, if you didn't see some of the values listed above, they might be in default value. You can check the values by clicking "Edit" on domain policies to check its default values.

You also need to create a dedicated user that receives Windows Events from Domain Controller and reports the events to NT Key caching service. You can create the user following the steps below:

* log on to PacketFence Admin UI, in *Users* section, create a user with a strong, unique password.

* in the following *Access Level* field, change it to *Windows Event Receiver NTLM*

This *username* and *password* will be needed in the next step - Config Windows Event Notifier PowerShell script.

==== Active Directory Configuration

You still need to report the account *password change*, *account password reset* to PacketFence in order to help NT Key cache invalidate cache entries accurately.

If you wish to invalidate the cache entry immediately after an account unlock in the Domain Controller, you'll also need to report user account unlock event, otherwise, an user lock state will be cached up to 60s after unlock from Domain Controller.

===== Config Windows Event Notifier

Windows Event Notifier is a powershell script used to filter, analyze and report account management events to PacketFence. Which includes:

 * Account password change - Windows Event ID: 4723
 * Account password reset - Windows Event ID: 4724
 * User account unlock - Windows Event ID: 4767


CAUTION: *Account password reset* and *Account password change* events must be reported in order to keep NT Key cache work properly. Otherwise, staled cache entries will be kept and cause authentication failures.

User account unlock events report is optional, but recommended.

===== Preparation

* Copy `/usr/local/pf/addons/AD/password_change_notifier.ps1` to *each* Domain Controller has NT Key cache enabled.
* Edit the script, Fill in the *PacketFence Server IP*, *username* and *password* we set for Windows Event Reporter in previous step.

===== Config Scheduled Tasks

=====
* Go to *Task Scheduler*, in the left panel, expand *Event Viewer Tasks*, on the right panel, right click on the blank area and select *Create new task...*

image::domain-nt-key-cache-task-scheduler.jpg[scalewidth="100%", alt="Windows Task Scheduler"]

* In the popup window, Name the task, and select *Run whether user is logged on or not* in *Security options*.
* Click on *Trigger* Tab, then *New...* button, on the popup window, select *On an event* for *Begin the task*, and *Security* for *Log* field, then type in *4723* for *Event ID* field, click "OK".

image::domain-nt-key-cache-task-scheduler-triggers.jpg[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Windows Events Triggers in Task Scheduler"]

* Repeat the previous step to add event trigger for event *Password Reset* and *User Account Unlock*, User Account Unlock event Report is optional.
* Click on *Action* tab, select *Start a program* for *Action* field, in *Program/script* field, type in full path of powershell.exe, it's usually `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`.
* In *Add arguments* field, type in the full path of the powershell script, e.g., if you copied and saved it on `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\event-notifier.ps1`
* In *Start in* field, type in the working directory you'd like it to run. It's optional but will be easier for troubleshooting purpose, E.g., let's put it the same directory where the powershell script locates: `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop`

image::domain-nt-key-cache-task-scheduler-actions.jpg[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Windows Events Actions"]

* Click "OK" to save the changes, you will be asked for Administrator password.
=====

or

=====
 * Go to *Windows Event Viewer*, try to locate an event with EventID = *4723* or *4724*. These are event IDs for password change and password reset respectively.

image::domain-windows-events-viewer.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Windows Events Viewer"]

* Click on any event with event ID of *4723* or *4724*, select *Attach tasks to this event* in the right panel, then choose *Launch a program* for action option, fill in the `powershell REAL_ABSOLUTE_PATH_OF_THE_NOTIFIER_SCRIPT`, click save.

image::domain-event-trigger-in-task-scheduler.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Windows Events Trigger in Task Scheduler"]

 * Repeat the same step above for another event ID.
 * After saving the task, it can be found and modified in *Task Scheduler*, Make sure this script will run under *Administrator Privilege*, otherwise it will fail to read windows events.
=====

===== Finalize and Test

Manually reset a user password and see if PacketFence got events.

==== Restart NTLM Auth API

Restart PacketFence NTLM Auth API to take effect.

```
systemctl restart packetfence-ntlm-auth-api
```

or restart the service form Admin UI.


=== NTLM Authentication Caching

NOTE: This section assumes that you already have an Active Directory domain configuration both in _Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Domains -> Active Directory Domains_ and _Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Authentication Sources_. If you don't, you need to first configure those. Refer to the appropriate sections of this guide for details on how to configure those two components.

CAUTION: The cache requires minimally Windows Server 2008. Older versions will not work.

When using NTLM authentication against an Active Directory for 802.1X EAP-PEAP connections, this can become a bottleneck when handling dozens of authentications per seconds.

To overcome this limitation, it is possible to use a Redis driven cache inside PacketFence to reduce the amount of authentications requiring an external NTLM authentication call. Should a user be in the cache, PacketFence will attempt to compare the 802.1X credentials with those. In the even that the validation fails, a call to ntlm_auth is made. In the event of a cache miss, an ntlm_auth call is made as well. This ensures that even if a user changes his password, his new password is immediately valid for 802.1X EAP-PEAP connections even if the cache contains the outdated entry.

NOTE: The NTLM cache doesn't cache clear text passwords, it caches the NT hash of the user password.

==== PacketFence Configuration

First of all, you will need to enable the NTLM caching globally by enabling 'NTLM Redis cache' in _Configuration -> System Configuration -> Radius -> General_. You then need to restart `radiusd-auth` service.

Once that is done, you need to configure PacketFence to start caching the
credentials. In order to do so, go in _Configuration -> Policies and Access
Control -> Domains -> Active Directory Domains_ and select the domain you want
to cache the credentials for.

Next, go in the *NTLM cache* tab and:

 * Enable 'NTLM cache'
 * Select the Active Directory authentication source that is tied to this domain.
 * Adjust the 'Expiration'

image::domain-ntlm-cache.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Domain NTLM cache"]

Once done, click on `Save` to commit your changes.

After that, you will need to enable the `redis_ntlm_cache` service which is used by PacketFence to store the cached credentials. In order to do so, go in _Configuration -> System Configuration -> Main Configuration -> Services_ and enable 'redis_ntlm_cache' and save the changes.

Next, start the service via pfcmd:

  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service redis_ntlm_cache start

==== Active Directory configuration

In order for PacketFence to be able to fetch the NTLM credentials from your Active Directory, it will need a user who has replication rights. The user to which you have to grant the rights, is the one that is configured in the authentication source that you associated in the 'NTLM cache' section of your domain.

Please refer to the following Microsoft KB entry to configure the replication rights (Replicating Directory Changes and Replicating Directory Changes All): https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/303972

=== SNMP Traps Limit

PacketFence mainly rely on SNMP traps to communicate with equipment. Due to the fact that traps coming in from approved (configured) devices are all processed by the daemon, it is possible for someone who want to generate a certain load on the PacketFence server to force the generation of non-legitimate SNMP traps or a switch can randomly generate a high quantity of traps sent to PacketFence for an unknown reason.

Because of that, it is possible to limit the number of SNMP traps coming in from a single switch port and take action if that limit is reached. For example, if over 100 traps are received by PacketFence from the same switch port in a minute, the switch port will be shut and a notification email will be sent.

Here's the default config for the SNMP traps limit feature. As you can see, by default, PacketFence will log the abnormal activity after 100 traps from the same switch port in a minute. These configurations are in the `conf/pf.conf` file:

  [snmp_traps]
  trap_limit = enabled
  trap_limit_threshold = 100
  trap_limit_action =

Alternatively, you can configure these parameters from the PacketFence Web administrative GUI, in the _Configuration -> Network Configuration -> SNMP_ section.

=== MariaDB optimizations

==== Tuning MariaDB

If you're PacketFence system is acting very slow, this could be due to your MariaDB configuration. You should do the following to tune performance:

Check the system load

  # uptime
  11:36:37 up 235 days,  1:21,  1 user, load average: 1.25, 1.05, 0.79

Check iostat and CPU

  # iostat 5
  avg-cpu:  %user   %nice    %sys %iowait   %idle
             0.60    0.00    3.20   20.20   76.00
  Device:            tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
  cciss/c0d0       32.40         0.00      1560.00          0       7800
  avg-cpu:  %user   %nice    %sys %iowait   %idle
             0.60    0.00    2.20    9.20   88.00
  Device:            tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
  cciss/c0d0        7.80         0.00        73.60          0        368
  avg-cpu:  %user   %nice    %sys %iowait   %idle
             0.60    0.00    1.80   23.80   73.80
  Device:            tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
  cciss/c0d0       31.40         0.00      1427.20          0       7136
  avg-cpu:  %user   %nice    %sys %iowait   %idle
             0.60    0.00    2.40   18.16   78.84
  Device:            tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
  cciss/c0d0       27.94         0.00      1173.65          0       5880

As you can see, the load-average is 1.25 and iowait is peaking at 20% - this is not good. If your iowait is low but your MariaDB is taking over %50 CPU this is also not good. Check your MariaDB install for the following variables:

  MariaDB> show variables;
  | innodb_additional_mem_pool_size | 1048576      |
  | innodb_autoextend_increment     | 8            |
  | innodb_buffer_pool_awe_mem_mb   | 0            |
  | innodb_buffer_pool_size         | 8388608      |

PacketFence relies heavily on InnoDB, so you should increase the `buffer_pool` size from the default values.

Go in the administration GUI , in _Configuration -> System Configuration -> Database -> Advanced_ and raise the value of *InnoDB buffer pool size*.

Then restart packetfence-mariadb

  # systemctl restart packetfence-mariadb

Wait 10 minutes re-check iostat and CPU

----

==== Avoid "Too many connections" problems

In a wireless context, there tends to be a lot of connections made to the database by our `freeradius` module. The default MariaDB value tend to be low (100) so we encourage you to increase that value to at least 300. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/too-many-connections.html for details.

==== Avoid "Host <hostname> is blocked" problems

In a wireless context, there tend to be a lot of connections made to the database by our freeradius module. When the server is loaded, these connection attempts can timeout. If a connection times out during connection, MariaDB will consider this a connection error and after 10 of these (by default) he will lock the host out with a:

  Host 'host_name' is blocked because of many connection errors. Unblock with 'mysqladmin flush-hosts'

This will grind PacketFence to a halt so you want to avoid that at all cost. One way to do so is to increase the number of maximum connections (see above), to periodically flush hosts or to allow more connection errors. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/blocked-host.html for details.

==== Using MariaDB-backup

When dealing with a large database, the database backup and maintenance script (`/usr/local/pf/addons/backup-and-maintenance.sh`) which uses mysqldump may create a long lock on your database which may cause service to hang.

This is fixed easily by using MariaDB-backup which can complete a full database backup without locking your tables.

.RHEL-based systems
[source,bash]
----
yum install MariaDB-backup --enablerepo=packetfence
----

.Debian-based systems (for PacketFence versions 11.0.0 and later
[source,bash]
----
apt install mariadb-backup
----

.Debian-based systems (for PacketFence versions prior to 11.0.0)
[source,bash]
----
apt install mariadb-backup-10.2
----

Once this is done, grant the proper rights to the `pf` user (or the one you configured in pf.conf):

  # mysql -u root -p
  MariaDB> GRANT PROCESS, RELOAD, LOCK TABLES, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'pf'@'localhost';
  MariaDB> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Next, run the maintenance script [filename]`/usr/local/pf/addons/backup-and-maintenance.sh` and ensure that the following line is part of the output:

  innobackupex: completed OK!

If the backup fails, check [filename]`/usr/local/pf/logs/innobackup.log` for details and refer to the MariaDB-backup documentation for troubleshooting.

NOTE: In the event that you want to stop using MariaDB-backup for your MariaDB backups, simply uninstall it and the database script will fallback to mysqldump.

=== Captive Portal Optimizations

=== Troubleshooting

This section will address specific problems and known solutions.

==== "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage"

Problem: Internet Explorer 8-10 may raise an "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" error while attempting to access PacketFence administration interface because TLSv1.2 is not activated but required since PacketFence 7.

Solution:

 * PacketFence administration interface is not started:

  # cd /usr/local/pf
  # bin/pfcmd service httpd.admin start


 * It is strongly advised that you update your browser to Internet Explorer 11 or download an alternative.


 * TLSv1.2 needs to be activated manually in Internet Explorer 8-10.

  Within Internet Explorer: click `Tools -> Internet Options -> Advanced` and make sure that TLS v1.2 is enabled under the security section. Retry.
