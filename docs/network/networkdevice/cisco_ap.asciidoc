CAUTION: With this equipment, the same VLAN cannot be shared between two SSIDs. Have this in mind in your design. For example, you need two isolation VLAN if you want to isolate hosts on the public and secure SSIDs.

==== Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) or Wireless Services Module (WiSM)

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the WiSM for PacketFence using the web interface.

* First, globally define the FreeRADIUS server running on PacketFence
  (PacketFence's IP) and make sure _Support for RFC 3576_ (also called _Support for CoA_) is enabled. When the option is missing from your WLC, it is enabled by default.

image::cisco-wlc-radius-define.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Freeradius server"]

* Then we create two SSIDs:
[options="compact"]
** PacketFence-Public: non-secure with MAC authentication only
** PacketFence-Secure: secure with WPA2 Enterprise PEAP/MSCHAPv2

image::cisco-wlc-ssid-create.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID creation"]

* In the secure SSID, make sure 802.1X is enabled and select the appropriate encryption for your needs (recommended: WPA + WPA2)

image::cisco-wlc-l2-secu.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID L2 secure"]

* No layer 3 security

image::cisco-wlc-l3-secu.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID L3 secure"]

* We set the IP of the FreeRADIUS server

image::cisco-wlc-secure-radius.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Radius secure"]

* VERY IMPORTANT: Allow AAA override (this allows VLAN assignment from RADIUS)

image::cisco-wlc-secure-radius-advance.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Radius advanced secure"]

* Edit the non-secure SSID: Enable MAC authentication at level 2

image::cisco-wlc-l2-non-secure.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID L2 non secure"]

* Nothing at level 3

image::cisco-wlc-l3-non-secure.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID L3 non secure"]

* We set the IP of the FreeRADIUS server

image::cisco-wlc-secure-radius.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Radius secure"]

* VERY IMPORTANT: Allow AAA override (this allows VLAN assignment from RADIUS)

image::cisco-wlc-non-secure-radius-advance.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Radius advanced non secure"]

* Finally, in _Controller -> Interfaces_ tab, create an interface per VLAN that could be assigned

image::cisco-wlc-interface-ssid.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID Interface"]

WARNING: When creating interfaces, it's important to configure DHCP servers. Otherwise, WLC will block DHCP requests.

You are good to go!

===== Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Web Auth

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the WLC Web Auth for PacketFence using the web interface.
The idea is to forward the device to the captive portal with an ACL if the device is in an unreg state and 
allow the device to reach Internet (or the normal network) by changing the ACL once registered.
In the unreg state, the WLC will intercept the HTTP traffic and forward the device to the captive portal.

In this sample configuration, the captive portal uses the IP address 172.16.0.250, the administration interface
uses the IP address 172.16.0.249 and the WLC uses the IP address 172.16.0.248.
The DHCP and DNS servers are not managed by PacketFence (WLC DHCP Server, Production DHCP Server)

* First, globally define the FreeRADIUS server running on PacketFence
  (PacketFence's Administration Interface) and make sure _Support for RFC 3576_ is enabled (if not present it is enabled by default)

* Then we create a SSID:
[options="compact"]
** OPEN SSID: non-secure with MAC authentication only

image::SSID_1.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 1"]

image::SSID_2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 2"]

image::SSID_3.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 3"]

image::SSID_4.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 4"]

image::SSID_5.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 5"]

image::SSID_6.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 6"]

NOTE: On more recent controllers, the value 'Radius NAC' in the 'NAC State' setting will be called 'ISE NAC'.

image::SSID_7.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 7"]

* Then you have to create two ACLs - one to deny all traffic except the required one to hit the portal (Pre-Auth-For-WebRedirect ) and the other
one to allow anything (Authorize_any) .

image::ACL.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="ACL"]

* Then the last step is to configure the WLC in PacketFence.

===== Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) IPSK

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the WLC IPSK feature.
Starting from WLC 8.5 release, Cisco introduces the IPSK feature.
Identity PSKs are unique pre-shared keys created for individuals or groups of users on the same SSID.

In this section we will cover the WLC configuration and the PacketFence configuration.

WLC Configuration:


* First, globally define the RADIUS server running on PacketFence
  (PacketFence's IP) and make sure _Support for RFC 3576_ (also called _Support for CoA_) is enabled. When the option is missing from your WLC, it is enabled by default.

* Next, configure a new SSID like in the following screenshots

image::ipsk1.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 1"]

image::ipsk2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 2"]

image::ipsk_radius.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 3"]

image::ipsk_advanced.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 4"]

PacketFence Configuration:

* First because there is no way to detect in the RADIUS request that the request is for an SSID configured for IPSK, you need to configure PacketFence to trigger IPSK on a connection profile.
  To do that, create a new connection profile, set a Filter based on the SSID (Example SSID PSK_SSID), enable IPSK and set a default PSK key.
  So each time a device will connect on this specific SSID PacketFence will know that it has to answer with specific VSA attributes.

* Second step is to associate the device to a user, you have two ways to do it, the first one is to manually edit an user and in Miscellaneous tab fill the PSK entry (8 characters minimum) then edit
  a node and change the owner with the one you just edit before.
  The second way to associate the device is to use a provisioner. There are also 2 ways to do it, use the "IPSK" provisioner (it will show you a page on the portal with the PSK key to use and the 
  SSID to connect to, or use the "Windows/Apple Devices/Android" provisioner and configure it to do IPSK.

image::wlc-9800-pf-switch-roles-2.jpg[scaledwidth="100%",alt="PF Switch Role configuration"]

==== Troubleshooting ignored RADIUS replies

In the event the WLC ignores the RADIUS replies from PacketFence (you receive multiple requests but access is never granted), validate the following elements : 

* RADIUS secret is properly configured in PacketFence and the WLC controller.
* The SSL certificate used by PacketFence is not expired.

==== Device Sensor

When using a Cisco WLC, you can enable device sensor by making sure the configuration looks like the following screenshot:

image::wlc-device-sensor.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Device Sensor"]

NOTE: Please refer to the wired configuration of Cisco equipment to learn more about device sensor.
