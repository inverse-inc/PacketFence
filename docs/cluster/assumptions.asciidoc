* The servers must have IPv6 disabled (see next section)
* The servers must have a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to identify them
* The servers are located within the following latency limits (requirement for Galera cluster)
** For smaller deployments, 75ms of latency can be tolerated between the cluster nodes
** For larger deployments, 50ms of latency can be tolerated between the cluster nodes
