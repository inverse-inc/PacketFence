//== Development environment setup

This section will guide you through the setup of your development environment and once done, you will have an environment running the sources in `/usr/local/pf`.

First, you will need to deploy an RHEL 8 or Rocky 8 machine. No other operating systems are currently supported for a development environment.

NOTE: If you're running on Linode, disable Network helper: https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/network-helper/

Now, you need to figure out what is the current devel version number, you can obtain it from here: https://github.com/inverse-inc/packetfence/blob/devel/conf/pf-release

IMPORTANT: This example will use version `99.9` as the example version number.

Next, install PacketFence from the RPM repository:

[source,bash]
----
yum localinstall http://packetfence.org/downloads/PacketFence/RHEL8/packetfence-release-99.9.el8.noarch.rpm -y
yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) -y
yum install packetfence --enablerepo=packetfence --allowerasing
----

Now, you must go through the configurator and validate you can login into the admin interface at the end.

Next, run:

[source,bash]
----
dnf module install nodejs:20
bash /usr/local/pf/addons/dev-helpers/setup-dev-env.sh
----

You will now have to wait for 10-15 minutes after the startup so that all container images are built (they're built on runtime when using a dev environment)
