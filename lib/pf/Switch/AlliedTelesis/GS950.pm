pf::Switch::AlliedTelesis::GS950

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Allied Telesis module for switches running the AT-S110 image

=head1 STATUS

Developed and tested on a GS950 running 'AT-S110 V2.0.2 (1.00.019)'

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=head2 MAB fallback does not work

There is no way to do 802.1x with MAB as a fallback method. It is either one or the other.

=head2 MAB uses EAP-MD5

The MAB uses EAP-MD5 which requires a FreeRADIUS policy to transform the EAP-MD5 request so PacketFence sees it as MAB.
See the Network Devices Configuration Guide for details on that.
