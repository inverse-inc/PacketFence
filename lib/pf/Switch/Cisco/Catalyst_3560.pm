pf::Switch::Cisco::Catalyst_3560

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object oriented module to access and configure Cisco Catalyst 3560 switches

This module is currently only a placeholder, see pf::Switch::Cisco::Cisco_IOS_15_0.

=head1 SUPPORT STATUS

=over

=item port-security

12.2(50)SE1 has been reported to work fine

12.2(25)SEC1 has issues

=item port-security + Voice over IP (VoIP)

Recommended IOS is 12.2(55)SE4.

=item MAC-Authentication / 802.1X

The hardware should support it.

802.1X support was never tested by Inverse.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Because a lot of code is shared with the Cisco_IOS_12_x make sure to check the BUGS AND LIMITATIONS section of
L<pf::Switch::Cisco::Cisco_IOS_12_x> also.

=over

=item port-security + Voice over IP (VoIP)

=over

=item IOS 12.2(25r) disappearing config

For some reason when securing a MAC address the switch loses an important portion of its config.
This is a Cisco bug, nothing much we can do. Don't use this IOS for VoIP.
See issue #1020 for details.

=item IOS 12.2(55)SE1 voice VLAN issues

For some reason this IOS doesn't put VoIP devices in the voice VLAN correctly.
This is a Cisco bug, nothing much we can do. Don't use this IOS for VoIP.
12.2(55)SE4 is working fine.

=head1 SNMP
