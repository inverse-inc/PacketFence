=head2 is_valid

Checks whether or not, a given IPv6 address is valid

This sub can either be called in a procedural or object way

Takes a pf::IPv6 (object call) or an IPv6 address (procedural call) as parameter

Returns a valid IPv6 address from the pf::IPv6 object on success

Returns undef on failure

=cut

sub is_valid {
    my $self = shift;
    # Allow an object/procedural way of calling this sub (will instantiate an object and then call itself)
    if ( ref($self) ne __PACKAGE__ ) {
        my $name = (split '\:\:', (caller(0))[3])[-1];
        return __PACKAGE__->new($self)->$name();
    }

    return $self->ipv6;
