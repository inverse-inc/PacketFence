Is a scoped statsd timer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Simple usage example

    sub function {

        ...
        # Will send stats for function when $timer goes out of scope
    }

How to use multiple timers with the same function

    sub function {
        my $timer = pf::StatsD::Timer->new;
        ...
        my $result = do {
            my $timer2 = pf::StatsD::Timer->new({'stat' => 'nameofstat.timing'});
            # $timer2 will go our of scope at the end of the do block
            # the do black will return the results of other_function();
            other_function();
        };
        ...
        # Will send stats for function when $timer goes out of scope
    }

    sub function {
        my $timer = pf::StatsD::Timer->new;
        ... # Send stats in t

        ...
        # Will send stats for function when $timer goes out of scope
    }
