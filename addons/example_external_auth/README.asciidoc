First install php on your server

Then add the following in /usr/local/pf/conf/httpd.conf.d/httpd.admin
```
Listen 10000
LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so

<FilesMatch \.php$>
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

<VirtualHost *:10000>
    DocumentRoot /usr/local/pf/addons/example_external_auth
</VirtualHost>
```
