captiveportal::Role::MultiSource

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MultiSource role to apply on a module to allow it to use multiple sources

=cut

use Moose::Role;
use pf::log;
use List::Util qw(first);
use List::MoreUtils qw(uniq);
use pf::constants;

has 'source_id' => (is => 'rw', trigger => \&_build_sources );

has 'sources' => (is => 'rw', default => \&_build_sources);

has 'multi_source_types' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'ArrayRef[Str]', default => sub{[]});

has 'multi_source_auth_classes' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'ArrayRef[Str]', default => sub{[]});

has 'multi_source_object_classes' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'ArrayRef[Str]', default => sub{[]});

=head2 display

The module should only be displayed if it has sources

=cut

sub display {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return @{$self->sources} ? $TRUE : $FALSE;
}

=head2 around source

Record the current active source after it has been set

=cut

    my ($orig, $self, $source) = @_;

    # We don't modify the setting behavior
    if($source){

    }
};

=head2 _build_sources

Build the sources from the source_id and the filtering attributes
If source_id is not defined or empty, the filtering attributes will be applied to all the portal profile sources
Otherwise, the sources defined in source_id will be used even if they are not part of the portal profile
